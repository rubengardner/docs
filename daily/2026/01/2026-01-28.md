## Focus

- Finish the UI. Go climbing

## Work

- I got an interview for Cabify. I did the leetcode interview for Affirm and it didn't go to well. I manage to do 2 thirds so not terrible.

## Personal

- I climbed on Saturday and I did moonboard. I went all out, I tried a couple of 6B and they where hard. I was exhausted after that. Could not do climb 6B. I was able to do a 6A+. Today I climbed on the Kilter at 40º. I flashed up to 6B and then went to do some power endurance with the traverse. I like my new routine, where I have 2 days of rest between climbing sessions. I'm feeling a lot healthier and stronger
  Yesterday was my birthday. It was a lot of fun. I texted a bunch of people and they all came to the office. I had breakfeast with Elena, Juan and Gamiz. Lunch was amazing thanks to Cassie, she made me a pumpkin cake! She also got me a bunch of presents and took me out for dinner at "El Humo". We had an excellent dinner. Tartar, avocado canelloni and meat. Delicious!

## Open loops
