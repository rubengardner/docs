# 2026-01-15 <!-- auto-replace with today -->

## Focus

- One thing that matters most today

## Work

- Slow morning. Blocked by the realse of auth.
- Typos in neovim. Added to Todoist
- Local setup is tedious. I would need to invest time into setting up local databases

## Personal

- Start the MD repo to track my notes. This is cool

## Open loops

- Local enviroment task, added to Todoist (In order to be able to debug, I need
  all services running locally. I need to fix databases and have a graph,
  commands to make everything setup instantly. I think too long when ever
  I need to run something. Maybe I can automate it.)

## Quick Wins / Highlights

- I finally understood the issue with github ssh. I had 3 ssh keys.
  Now it's fix and i need to set the host for each repo.
  Super easy, so many hours of my life waisted lol.
  example git@github-work:your-org/repo.git
