# Evening Routine

Goal: extract signal and close the day.

## Steps (3-7 minutes)

1. Add a short reflection to today's daily note

   Answer briefly:

   - What moved forward?
   - What stalled (and why)?

2. Review open loops

   - If something is actionable → add to Todoist
   - Otherwise, leave it

3. Close the day  
   Add a final line:

   - Done for today

4. Close Neovim

## Rules

- No rewriting or polishing notes
- No backfilling missed days
- If tired, skip reflection and just close the note

Done.
