# Morning Routine

Goal: orient attention, not plan everything.

## Steps (5 minutes max)

1. Open today’s daily note

   - Run the daily note command
   - Do not review yesterday

2. Define today’s focus  
   Write **one** outcome that would make today successful.

   Examples:

   - Clarify retry semantics
   - Get workshop structure out of my head
   - Finish CRUD tester abstraction

3. Quick Todoist scan (30 seconds)

   - Check for urgent commitments
   - Do not reorganize or plan

4. Start working

## Rules

- One focus only
- No task lists in the daily note
- If this feels heavy, do only steps 1 and 2

Done.
